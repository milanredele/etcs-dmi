# ETCS on-board (EVC) — Plan

> **Status (2026-09-27):** phase E0 closed (§5). Next: E1 (language) and
> E2 (position) in parallel, then E3.
> The DMI is complete for its scope (PLAN.md §7 closed 2026-09-26). This
> document plans the second product of the repository: an ETCS on-board
> implementing SUBSET-026 v4.0.0, runnable on a microcontroller of the
> TI Hercules family, tested with the same bench and the same discipline
> as the DMI.

## 1. What the on-board is, and what it is not

SUBSET-026 ([doc/SRS/SUBSET-026_v400](SRS/SUBSET-026_v400/README.md))
specifies the ETCS on-board *logic*. Everything below it is in other
subsets, which are interfaces the on-board uses, not behaviour it owns:

| Interface | Subset | In this project |
|---|---|---|
| Eurobalise air gap, telegram coding | SUBSET-036 | Out. The BTM port delivers decoded telegrams (the bit string of chapter 8.4.2 after the 1023/341 bit decoding). |
| Euroradio, safety layer, FRMCS | SUBSET-037 | Out. The RTM port delivers chapter 8 radio messages; session set-up of 3.5 is in, the safety layer (SaPDU, keys) is not. |
| Odometry accuracy | SUBSET-041 | Out. The odometer port delivers distance, speed, their confidence intervals and the direction; `sim/` models the errors. |
| Train interface (brakes, traction, cab, doors, pantograph, main switch…) | SUBSET-034 | Out. The TIU port carries the signals SUBSET-034 names, as typed Ada values. |
| Juridical recording | SUBSET-027 | Out. The JRU port receives the events the on-board must record; no file format. |
| STM / national systems | SUBSET-035 | Out, as for the DMI (PLAN.md scope decision). Level NTC and mode SN exist as level and mode; no STM interface. |
| ATO on-board | SUBSET-125, SUBSET-130 | Out of the EVC. The ATO of `sim/evc_ato` becomes a separate module on the ATO port with the ETCS-side conditions of 4.4.16 and 3.15.11. |
| Safety case | — | The code is structured for it (static memory, cyclic executive, no exception propagation, SPARK kernel with proofs). It is not certified and the README says so. |

Scope of the SRS itself: levels 0, 1 and 2 in full; Euroloop and radio
infill (3.9) deferred; chapter 6 (system versions X = 1 and X = 2) as a
late phase; chapter 9 is the coverage matrix (§4).

The subsets above are public at
[ERA, CCS TSI Appendix A](https://www.era.europa.eu/era-folder/1-ccs-tsi-appendix-mandatory-specifications-etcs-b4-r1-rmr-gsm-r-b1-mr1-frmcs-b0-ato-b1);
those needed for the port definitions are imported under `doc/SRS/` as they
are used. SUBSET-076 (test cases and sequences) is the validation material
for E3 to E5.

## 2. Architecture

Same shape as the DMI, because that shape is proven to build on the host,
on wasm32 and on a light runtime, and to be testable headless:

- **Pure core** `EVC_Core` in `evc/`: `Initialise`, `Handle_Input (Port,
  Payload)`, `Tick (Dt_Ms)`, `Take_Outputs`. No tasking, no exception
  propagation, no `Interfaces.C`, no allocation. Every store is bounded by
  the packet iteration limits of chapter 7 (`N_ITER` is 5 bits) or by a
  documented engineering constant.
- **Ports** are an enumeration: BTM, RTM, odometer, TIU, DMI, ATO, JRU.
  Inputs arrive as byte payloads of documented shape (as the DMI protocol
  does), outputs leave the same way. The hosted, wasm and target glue only
  moves bytes.
- **Cyclic executive** with a fixed period. One tick does, in this order:
  read the ports, update the position, evaluate stored information, speed
  and distance monitoring, mode machine, produce outputs. The order is part
  of the specification of the goldens.
- **ERTMS/ETCS language as data**: a bit-level codec driven by tables of
  variables and packets, generated into Ada from the chapter 7 markdown by
  a Python tool next to `import_subset026.py`, the way fonts are generated.
- **Traceability**: the on-board column of chapter 9 imported into a table
  of clauses with a status each (§4). It is the coverage matrix and the
  audit tool.
- **Verification**: `evc_test`, a golden runner where a golden is the
  recorded output of a scenario (the byte stream of every port), plus the
  DMI frame goldens through the real chain; `evc_fuzz` with the `raised:
  0` rule; gnatprove on the kernel packages for absence of run-time errors,
  and functional contracts where the SRS states a property directly (limits
  ordered, a mode transition only from its source modes, …).
- **SPARK**: `SPARK_Mode (On)` on `evc/` from the first package. What leaves
  SPARK is stated per unit with the reason. The proof runs in the regular
  check (`gnatprove -P etcs_evc.gpr`), not as an afterthought.

### Repository layout (E0)

```
common/        DMI–EVC protocol, frame reassembly (shared)
dmi/           the DMI (was src/)
evc/           the ETCS on-board
sim/           environment: track, train, driver, ATO, EVC_Mock
ports/hosted/  native TCP mains
test/src/      dmi_test, dmi_fuzz, evc_test, evc_fuzz, host helpers
test/wasm/     browser bench and wasm glue
etcsdmi.gpr    host build of everything (Alire crate)
etcs_evc.gpr   the on-board alone: cross build and proof
```

`EVC_Mock` (was `sim/evc_core`) is the simplified on-board the DMI goldens
were recorded against. It stays as the reference until E4, and every
DMI-visible difference between it and the on-board is a decision, not an
accident.

## 3. Phases

| Phase | Content | SRS | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| **E0 Foundation** | Repository split, `EVC_Core` skeleton with ports and scheduler, `evc_test` and `evc_fuzz`, SPARK and gnatprove in the build, chapter 9 matrix, cross build for arm-eabi, this plan | 9 | M |
| **E1 Language** | Codec generator, all track-to-train and train-to-track packets, radio messages, telegram fixtures, round trips, fuzz | 7, 8, A.3.11 | L |
| **E2 Position** | Balise groups, linking, train position and confidence interval, relocation, odometer accuracy monitoring, cold movement, train orientation | 3.4, 3.6, 3.15.8, 5.12 | L |
| **E3 Supervision** | SSP, ASP, TSR, gradients, conversion models, brake build-up, MRSP, EBD/SBD/GUI curves, supervision limits, commands, perturbation location, brake command handling, roll away protection. Replaces the constant-deceleration mock | 3.11, 3.12 (except 3.12.3), 3.13, 3.14, A.3.1, A.3.7 to A.3.10, A.3.12, A.3.13 | XL |
| **E4 Modes and procedures, level 1** | All 17 modes, 4.6 transitions, 4.8 acceptance, 4.10 stored information, 4.12 brakes, SoM and EoM in L0/L1, SH, override, OS, level transitions, trip, reversing, LS, SM, LX, track conditions and 5.20 outputs, train data changes, text messages | 4, 5 (except 5.12, 5.15), 3.12.3, A.3.3 to A.3.6 | XL |
| **E5 Radio, level 2** | Session management, MA request and update, co-operative shortening, emergency messages, position reports, handover, radio data consistency, SoM in L2, RBC simulator in `sim/` | 3.5, 3.8, 3.10, 3.15.1, 3.16.3, 5.15 | L |
| **E6 Special functions and data** | Non-leading engines, splitting and joining, TAF, big metal mass, VBC, advance route information, system version, national values, train data and data view, completeness of data, balise consistency, juridical data port | 3.7, 3.15 (rest), 3.16 (except 3.16.3), 3.17, 3.18, 3.20, A.3.2 | L |
| **E7 Compatibility** | Older system versions X = 1 and X = 2; Euroloop and radio infill if wanted | 6, 3.9 | L, deferrable |
| **E8 Hercules** | TMS570LC43x LaunchPad, `gnat_arm_elf` with a light runtime for TMS570 (bb-runtimes), RTI timer executive, ESM and lockstep fault reporting, DMI link over Ethernet with CRC and sequence numbers, memory and timing measurements | — | L |

Level 1 is drivable at the end of E4, level 2 at the end of E5. E1 and E2
are independent and can run as parallel branches, like the P4 branches of
the DMI. E3 is the critical path.

### Decisions taken

- **Target**: TMS570LC4357 (Cortex-R5F lockstep, 512 kB RAM, 4 MB flash).
  The TMS570 family is big-endian: multi-byte fields on any wire are read
  and written byte by byte, as the DMI protocol already does, never by
  overlay.
- **Floating point**: `Float` for the curves (Cortex-R4F/R5F have an FPU,
  the light runtime has the elementary functions). Bit-identical results
  across host, wasm and target are required for the goldens: no
  `Long_Float`, no fused operations, one rounding convention, and the
  proof of the kernel does not depend on floating point identities.
- **Formal verification**: SPARK on the safety kernel (position, speed and
  distance monitoring, brake commands, mode machine, codec) and wherever a
  proof is cheaper than a test; the host-only tooling and the bench are
  not SPARK.

## 4. Coverage matrix

[doc/TRACE-SUBSET-026.csv](TRACE-SUBSET-026.csv) lists every clause
chapter 9 classifies as an on-board requirement (2398 of the 5466 clauses
it classifies), with the chapter 9 flags, the phase of §3, a status and a
note. [doc/SRS/tools/trace_subset026.py](SRS/tools/trace_subset026.py)
produces it from the chapter 9 markdown; `--compare` re-reads the PDF
with a second parser and confirms every flag of every clause (0
differences at import), `--check` validates the file and prints the
counts per chapter, phase and status. The statuses are kept by hand and
preserved when the tool is rerun. Statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `todo` | not started |
| `partial` | implemented in part; the note says what is missing |
| `done` | implemented, with a scenario or a proof the note names |
| `n/a` | not applicable to this project; the note gives the reason (scope table of §1) |
| `deferred` | planned in a later phase; the note names it |

A phase is closed when every clause it lists is `done`, `n/a` or `deferred`
with a reason, and `evc_test`, `evc_fuzz`, `dmi_test`, `dmi_fuzz`,
gnatprove and the wasm smoke check are green.

## 5. E0 — Foundation: outcome (2026-09-27)

Four parallel branches on top of the repository split, merged into
`e0/foundation`.

**Core** (`evc/`, 1.25 kloc, six units, all `SPARK_Mode => On`, none
`Off`): `EVC_Core`, `EVC_Modes`, `EVC_Ports`, `EVC_DMI_Port`,
`EVC_Outbox`, `EVC_Bytes`. `common/` is not used by the on-board: it
frames the DMI protocol itself, byte by byte, and `evc_test` checks its
constants against `common/dmi_protocol.ads`. Behaviour: power-up in NP,
NP → SB (4.6.2 condition [4]), isolation by the driver from any mode
(condition [1], driver action 20, absorbing per 4.4.3.1.3), every cycle
MSG_MODE_LEVEL and MSG_ONBOARD on the DMI port, a JRU record per mode
change, national values at the A.3.2 defaults. The whole 4.6.2 table is
data in `EVC_Modes.Transitions` with priorities; it was checked against
the transition list rebuilt from the PDF page (159 transitions, no
difference). Inputs are latched and read at the start of the next Tick;
BTM and RTM inputs are checked for shape only (E1 decodes them); the
odometer and TIU shapes are provisional until E2 and E4.

**Proof**: `evc/prove.sh`, gnatprove 15.1.0 (Alire, installed outside
the repository), `--mode=all --level=2`: 289 checks, 0 unproved, 0
justified (129 run-time checks, 54 functional contracts, 12 assertions,
35 termination, 59 flow). Proven properties include: Tick never leaves
NP, a mode changes only along a 4.6.2 transition, IS is absorbing, from
NP the next mode is IS when isolation was requested and SB otherwise,
Handle_Input never changes the mode, Take_Outputs stays in its buffer
and outputs nothing once failed.

**Tests**: `evc_test` 132 checks, six goldens under `test/golden/evc/`;
`evc_fuzz` 10^6 steps, 0 raised, 0 contract violations. End to end: the
on-board's DMI output fed into `DMI_Core` draws the same start-up frame
as `EVC_Mock`, pixel for pixel, except area E1: the mock reported its
radio as connected from the start (ST03), the on-board has no session in
SB and shows nothing. `dmi_test` 2156 and `dmi_fuzz` unchanged; the wasm
bench builds and its smoke check is identical (evc/ is not in the wasm
build yet).

**Hosted main**: `ports/hosted/evc.adb`, built as `obj/evc_onboard`
(`obj/evc` is the object directory of `etcs_evc.gpr`), takes the hub
port of `evc_sim`.

**Cross build** (`ports/tms570/`): `gnat_arm_elf` 16.1.0 from Alire
(`alr get`, under `~/.local/share/etcs-dmi`, alr's defaults untouched)
with the shipped `light-tms570lc` runtime (Cortex-R5F, `-mbig-endian
-mbe32`, VFPv3-D16 hard float). Two fixes were needed and are made by
`setup-toolchain.sh`: the shipped light runtime has no `Ada.Streams`
(copied from the `embedded-tms570lc` runtime and rebuilt; `common/`
needs it, `evc/` does not), and the FSF toolchain has no big-endian
libgcc (built from the GCC 16.1 sources, about four minutes). `build.sh`
compiles `etcs_evc.gpr` for the target: 12.9 kB code, 2.2 kB data for
the E0 skeleton. Findings for later: `Stream_Element_Offset` is 64-bit
and drags in `__aeabi_ldivmod`, so kernel index arithmetic stays in
32-bit types; there is no exception propagation on the board, a failed
check halts it, which is why the proof is not optional.

**Coverage matrix**: 2398 on-board clauses (§4), all `todo` except the
156 of E7 (`deferred`) and the two general rules of chapter 1 (`n/a`).
Per phase: E1 380, E2 184, E3 426, E4 766, E5 219, E6 265, E7 156.

**Specifications imported** under `doc/SRS/`, all as PDF plus markdown
with an index, by the general `doc/SRS/tools/import_subset.py`: see
[doc/SRS/README.md](SRS/README.md). SUBSET-034 (TIU signals), 041
(performance values) and 130 (ATO packets) carry tables of what the ports
take from them. SUBSET-125 is at 1.1.0 on the ERA page. In 125 and 130
the clause numbers are images in the PDF and were read back with OCR,
checked by sequence and outline.

**SUBSET-076 for validation** (not committed, 2.2 GB of zips): part 5-2
is 613 test case PDFs per SRS feature and system version envelope (SV21,
SV22, SV30); part 6-3 is 3191 test sequences, each a PDF with the step
table (distance, level and mode before and after, event, interface),
every balise telegram and RBC message variable by variable, every DMI
event, an SVG of the speed profile, and for 772 of them the ERA braking
curve workbook. There is no machine-readable format: the telegram and
message tables can be parsed from the PDF text, the expected reactions
are sentences to translate into bench checks. Plan for E3: a converter
from a 6-3 sequence PDF to an `evc_test` scenario, starting with the
stimuli.

**Open points carried forward**
- E1: the codec generator; BTM/RTM payload shapes become the decoded
  telegram and message.
- E2/E4: the odometer and TIU port shapes (SUBSET-041, SUBSET-034) replace
  the provisional ones; the desk is taken as open until the cab signals
  are used.
- E8 list from the cross build: startup with ECC initialisation and
  self-tests (MINITGCR/MSINENA, STC, PBIST, flash ECC), own flash linker
  script with measured stacks, RTI tick, ESM handling, DWD watchdog, the
  DMI link over EMAC or SCI, flashing via XDS110.
- The 2.7 GB GCC build tree under `~/.local/share/etcs-dmi/build` can be
  deleted after the setup.
