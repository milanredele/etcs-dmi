# ETCS on-board (EVC) — Plan

> **Status (2026-09-27):** phase E0 in progress on branch `e0/foundation`.
> The DMI is complete for its scope (PLAN.md §7 closed 2026-09-26). This
> document plans the second product of the repository: an ETCS on-board
> implementing SUBSET-026 v4.0.0, runnable on a microcontroller of the
> TI Hercules family, tested with the same bench and the same discipline
> as the DMI.

## 1. What the on-board is, and what it is not

SUBSET-026 ([doc/SRS/SUBSET-026_v400](SRS/SUBSET-026_v400/README.md))
specifies the ETCS on-board *logic*. Everything below it is in other
subsets, which are interfaces the on-board uses, not behaviour it owns:

| Interface | Subset | In this project |
|---|---|---|
| Eurobalise air gap, telegram coding | SUBSET-036 | Out. The BTM port delivers decoded telegrams (the bit string of chapter 8.4.2 after the 1023/341 bit decoding). |
| Euroradio, safety layer, FRMCS | SUBSET-037 | Out. The RTM port delivers chapter 8 radio messages; session set-up of 3.5 is in, the safety layer (SaPDU, keys) is not. |
| Odometry accuracy | SUBSET-041 | Out. The odometer port delivers distance, speed, their confidence intervals and the direction; `sim/` models the errors. |
| Train interface (brakes, traction, cab, doors, pantograph, main switch…) | SUBSET-034 | Out. The TIU port carries the signals SUBSET-034 names, as typed Ada values. |
| Juridical recording | SUBSET-027 | Out. The JRU port receives the events the on-board must record; no file format. |
| STM / national systems | SUBSET-035 | Out, as for the DMI (PLAN.md scope decision). Level NTC and mode SN exist as level and mode; no STM interface. |
| ATO on-board | SUBSET-125, SUBSET-130 | Out of the EVC. The ATO of `sim/evc_ato` becomes a separate module on the ATO port with the ETCS-side conditions of 4.4.16 and 3.15.11. |
| Safety case | — | The code is structured for it (static memory, cyclic executive, no exception propagation, SPARK kernel with proofs). It is not certified and the README says so. |

Scope of the SRS itself: levels 0, 1 and 2 in full; Euroloop and radio
infill (3.9) deferred; chapter 6 (system versions X = 1 and X = 2) as a
late phase; chapter 9 is the coverage matrix (§4).

The subsets above are public at
[ERA, CCS TSI Appendix A](https://www.era.europa.eu/era-folder/1-ccs-tsi-appendix-mandatory-specifications-etcs-b4-r1-rmr-gsm-r-b1-mr1-frmcs-b0-ato-b1);
those needed for the port definitions are imported under `doc/SRS/` as they
are used. SUBSET-076 (test cases and sequences) is the validation material
for E3 to E5.

## 2. Architecture

Same shape as the DMI, because that shape is proven to build on the host,
on wasm32 and on a light runtime, and to be testable headless:

- **Pure core** `EVC_Core` in `evc/`: `Initialise`, `Handle_Input (Port,
  Payload)`, `Tick (Dt_Ms)`, `Take_Outputs`. No tasking, no exception
  propagation, no `Interfaces.C`, no allocation. Every store is bounded by
  the packet iteration limits of chapter 7 (`N_ITER` is 5 bits) or by a
  documented engineering constant.
- **Ports** are an enumeration: BTM, RTM, odometer, TIU, DMI, ATO, JRU.
  Inputs arrive as byte payloads of documented shape (as the DMI protocol
  does), outputs leave the same way. The hosted, wasm and target glue only
  moves bytes.
- **Cyclic executive** with a fixed period. One tick does, in this order:
  read the ports, update the position, evaluate stored information, speed
  and distance monitoring, mode machine, produce outputs. The order is part
  of the specification of the goldens.
- **ERTMS/ETCS language as data**: a bit-level codec driven by tables of
  variables and packets, generated into Ada from the chapter 7 markdown by
  a Python tool next to `import_subset026.py`, the way fonts are generated.
- **Traceability**: the on-board column of chapter 9 imported into a table
  of clauses with a status each (§4). It is the coverage matrix and the
  audit tool.
- **Verification**: `evc_test`, a golden runner where a golden is the
  recorded output of a scenario (the byte stream of every port), plus the
  DMI frame goldens through the real chain; `evc_fuzz` with the `raised:
  0` rule; gnatprove on the kernel packages for absence of run-time errors,
  and functional contracts where the SRS states a property directly (limits
  ordered, a mode transition only from its source modes, …).
- **SPARK**: `SPARK_Mode (On)` on `evc/` from the first package. What leaves
  SPARK is stated per unit with the reason. The proof runs in the regular
  check (`gnatprove -P etcs_evc.gpr`), not as an afterthought.

### Repository layout (E0)

```
common/        DMI–EVC protocol, frame reassembly (shared)
dmi/           the DMI (was src/)
evc/           the ETCS on-board
sim/           environment: track, train, driver, ATO, EVC_Mock
ports/hosted/  native TCP mains
test/src/      dmi_test, dmi_fuzz, evc_test, evc_fuzz, host helpers
test/wasm/     browser bench and wasm glue
etcsdmi.gpr    host build of everything (Alire crate)
etcs_evc.gpr   the on-board alone: cross build and proof
```

`EVC_Mock` (was `sim/evc_core`) is the simplified on-board the DMI goldens
were recorded against. It stays as the reference until E4, and every
DMI-visible difference between it and the on-board is a decision, not an
accident.

## 3. Phases

| Phase | Content | SRS | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| **E0 Foundation** | Repository split, `EVC_Core` skeleton with ports and scheduler, `evc_test` and `evc_fuzz`, SPARK and gnatprove in the build, chapter 9 matrix, cross build for arm-eabi, this plan | 9 | M |
| **E1 Language** | Codec generator, all track-to-train and train-to-track packets, radio messages, telegram fixtures, round trips, fuzz | 7, 8, A.3.11 | L |
| **E2 Position** | Balise groups, linking, train position and confidence interval, relocation, odometer accuracy monitoring, cold movement, train orientation | 3.4, 3.6, 3.15.8, 5.12 | L |
| **E3 Supervision** | SSP, ASP, TSR, gradients, conversion models, brake build-up, MRSP, EBD/SBD/GUI curves, supervision limits, commands, perturbation location, brake command handling, roll away protection. Replaces the constant-deceleration mock | 3.11, 3.12 (except 3.12.3), 3.13, 3.14, A.3.1, A.3.7 to A.3.10, A.3.12, A.3.13 | XL |
| **E4 Modes and procedures, level 1** | All 17 modes, 4.6 transitions, 4.8 acceptance, 4.10 stored information, 4.12 brakes, SoM and EoM in L0/L1, SH, override, OS, level transitions, trip, reversing, LS, SM, LX, track conditions and 5.20 outputs, train data changes, text messages | 4, 5 (except 5.12, 5.15), 3.12.3, A.3.3 to A.3.6 | XL |
| **E5 Radio, level 2** | Session management, MA request and update, co-operative shortening, emergency messages, position reports, handover, radio data consistency, SoM in L2, RBC simulator in `sim/` | 3.5, 3.8, 3.10, 3.15.1, 3.16.3, 5.15 | L |
| **E6 Special functions and data** | Non-leading engines, splitting and joining, TAF, big metal mass, VBC, advance route information, system version, national values, train data and data view, completeness of data, balise consistency, juridical data port | 3.7, 3.15 (rest), 3.16 (except 3.16.3), 3.17, 3.18, 3.20, A.3.2 | L |
| **E7 Compatibility** | Older system versions X = 1 and X = 2; Euroloop and radio infill if wanted | 6, 3.9 | L, deferrable |
| **E8 Hercules** | TMS570LC43x LaunchPad, `gnat_arm_elf` with a light runtime for TMS570 (bb-runtimes), RTI timer executive, ESM and lockstep fault reporting, DMI link over Ethernet with CRC and sequence numbers, memory and timing measurements | — | L |

Level 1 is drivable at the end of E4, level 2 at the end of E5. E1 and E2
are independent and can run as parallel branches, like the P4 branches of
the DMI. E3 is the critical path.

### Decisions taken

- **Target**: TMS570LC4357 (Cortex-R5F lockstep, 512 kB RAM, 4 MB flash).
  The TMS570 family is big-endian: multi-byte fields on any wire are read
  and written byte by byte, as the DMI protocol already does, never by
  overlay.
- **Floating point**: `Float` for the curves (Cortex-R4F/R5F have an FPU,
  the light runtime has the elementary functions). Bit-identical results
  across host, wasm and target are required for the goldens: no
  `Long_Float`, no fused operations, one rounding convention, and the
  proof of the kernel does not depend on floating point identities.
- **Formal verification**: SPARK on the safety kernel (position, speed and
  distance monitoring, brake commands, mode machine, codec) and wherever a
  proof is cheaper than a test; the host-only tooling and the bench are
  not SPARK.

## 4. Coverage matrix

[doc/TRACE-SUBSET-026.csv](TRACE-SUBSET-026.csv) lists every clause
chapter 9 classifies as an on-board requirement (2398 of the 5466 clauses
it classifies), with the chapter 9 flags, the phase of §3, a status and a
note. [doc/SRS/tools/trace_subset026.py](SRS/tools/trace_subset026.py)
produces it from the chapter 9 markdown; `--compare` re-reads the PDF
with a second parser and confirms every flag of every clause (0
differences at import), `--check` validates the file and prints the
counts per chapter, phase and status. The statuses are kept by hand and
preserved when the tool is rerun. Statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `todo` | not started |
| `partial` | implemented in part; the note says what is missing |
| `done` | implemented, with a scenario or a proof the note names |
| `n/a` | not applicable to this project; the note gives the reason (scope table of §1) |
| `deferred` | planned in a later phase; the note names it |

A phase is closed when every clause it lists is `done`, `n/a` or `deferred`
with a reason, and `evc_test`, `evc_fuzz`, `dmi_test`, `dmi_fuzz`,
gnatprove and the wasm smoke check are green.
